# Air-Pulse-Air-Quality-Map-Dashboard

## Brief Project Description
This project aims to create a delayed, web-based air quality map and dashboard system that displays a short delay of readings from AirGradient’s ambient monitors, using its open data feeds. The platform will include a public-facing map for awareness and institutional dashboards for stakeholders to analyse trends and evaluate interventions. Demonstrating the added value of hyperlocal monitoring and supporting evidence-based decision-making in school environments.
The objectives of this project are:
1.	Create a filter that allows users to select schools and/ or borough to view the devices. 
2.	Implement delayed data integration for its device reading on the map.
3.	Each device will be displayed by a clickable marker displaying its readings and school green initiatives. 
4.	Real-time air quality display with colour-coded indicators.
5.	Monthly summaries of spikes missed by gov data, average deviation and term time trends.
6.	Record spike detections during school drop-off and pick-up windows.
7.	Coordinate term-time awareness. (holidays; seasonal comparison)
8.	Pre- device onboarding
9.	Add boolean flags to the overlay system for green walls, cycle-to-school initiatives, awareness training, additional monitor types, and map must support toggling overlays on/off

## Tools Used for now
