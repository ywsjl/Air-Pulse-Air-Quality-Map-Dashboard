# Air-Pulse-Air-Quality-Map-Dashboard

## Brief Project Description
This project aims to create a delayed, web-based air quality map and dashboard system that displays a short delay of readings from AirGradient’s ambient monitors, using its open data feeds. The platform will include a public-facing map for awareness and institutional dashboards for stakeholders to analyse trends and evaluate interventions. Demonstrating the added value of hyperlocal monitoring and supporting evidence-based decision-making in school environments.
